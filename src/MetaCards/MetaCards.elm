                The cards can have recognizable types, so for example we can create a Human card
                that has information about a human; the information can be arbitrary, but from the
                GUI there are certain parameters that if used, enhance the visual experience, but the data
                model isn't in hard sense restricted, extra parameters the GUI is not prepared to read are just
                ignored.

                Among the parameters in cards, cards can also be linkeg to each other. So for example, if you have Human
                card you could link it to a Home card and a Family card or other Human cards. Those links can be interpreted
                from specific GUIs, and ignored in other GUIs.

                , ph """
                From the cards in the player Universe we can build graphical interfaces, by filtering, sorting and displaying
                the cards in the screen with specific "views". There could be some default views to just see the filtering/sorting
                raw information, and then we can program specific views for certain filtering parameters that extend the GUI
                to make information easier to digest.
