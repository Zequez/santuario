# Santuario

Imagine each city was a sanctuary for life, and we're all together
in this. How would we organize and coordinate our efforts so
that everyone's needs are met?

This repository is an exploratory work on discovering forms to
organize a community with a collaborative mindset.

For the things that are built here, the framework of choice is [Elm](https://elm-lang.org/),
just because it's a fun language to work with. Making decisions based on joy
is also something I can get behind.

The target platforms is the web, and mobile by the use of progressive web apps.

Temporarily you can find the experiments at https://santuario.zequez.space (It's in spanish for now!)

## A patchwork of tools

The purpose of this repository is not only to build, but also to document
existing tools that can be used by communities to work better together to
meet everyone's needs.

There are many tools out there that were built for specific purposes and that
work marvelous. Some of these tools may not scale on a decentralized fashion
or may not be open source. Nevertheless it's worth giving them a shot.
Besides, with enough love, these could be ported to decentralized technology
or could be open sourced.

There are also promising tools in development that are yet not ready for use,
but are worth keeping an eye on.

All of this is part of the digital commons movement.

## Questions that we seek to answer

I moved all this to the [Notion workspace where I'm managing all the tasks and goals of
the project](https://www.notion.so/Santuario-dddb4aa02d4b479d9f6b95cebb2a464f).

## Playing with the tools

Most of the things we can build, can be designed with a playful mentality, in a way
that feels like a game, which encourages joy. It's a fun to believe that app
development is actually game development.

## Beyond the tools

Building an app is not a magic solution, for most of these things a connection
with the community is vital. We can't help unless we connect with all the actors
implicated and come up with solutions through systemic thinking and non-violent
communication. The city is a beautifully complex interconnected network, and as
agents of social change that's part of the job.
