# Santuario

Imagine each city was a sanctuary for life, and we're all together
in this. How would we organize and coordinate our efforts so
that everyone's needs are met?

This repository is an exploratory work on discovering forms to
organize a community with a collaborative mindset.

For the things that are built here, the framework of choice is [Elm](https://elm-lang.org/),
just because it's a fun language to work with. Making decisions based on joy
is also something I can get behind.

The target platforms is the web, and mobile by the use of progressive web apps.

## A patchwork of tools

The purpose of this repository is not only to build, but also to document
existing tools that can be used by communities to work better together to
meet everyone's needs.

There are many tools out there that were built for specific purposes and that
work marvelous. Some of these tools may not scale on a decentralized fashion
or may not be open source. Nevertheless it's worth giving them a shot.
Besides, with enough love, these could be ported to decentralized technology
or could be open sourced.

There are also promising tools in development that are yet not ready for use,
but are worth keeping an eye on.

All of this is part of the digital commons movement.

## Questions that we seek to answer

> What are the needs of the community and how can we best meet those needs?

Questions are a way we can query the universal intelligence for answers, so I find
that they are very useful when we are trying to figure what the build and what are
our next steps.

- How may we best help lost animals reunite with their families?
- How may we organize local information in a way that we can explore all the community has to offer?
- How may we best visualize all the local activities and events happening?
- How may we connect to all the local organizations and the services they provide?
- How may we form a zero-waste circular economy?
- How may we coordinate shippings and transportation around the city?
- How may we coordinate community gardens?
- How may we form a holistic healthcare network that reaches everyone?
- How may we meet everyone needs in terms of food and housing?
- How may we organize to create urban improvements without the need of a centralized authority?
- How may we use digital currencies to facilitate the gifting of goods and services?
- How may we connect unused goods with people that can use them?
- How may we enable people to have free access to cultural resources such as books and audiovisual content?
- How may we best help people transition to a plant-based diet?
- How may we help food cooperatives reach everyone?
- How may we help shelters best fulfill their mission?
- How may we help animals without a family find a home?
- How may we help the community organizations communicate coherently between themselves and each other?

## Playing with the tools

Most of the things we can build, can be designed with a playful mentality, in a way
that feels like a game, which encourages joy. It's a fun to believe that app
development is actually game development.

## Beyond the tools

Building an app is not a magic solution, for most of these things a connection
with the community is vital. We can't help unless we connect with all the actors
implicated and come up with solutions through systemic thinking and non-violent
communication. The city is a beautifully complex interconnected network, and as
agents of social change that's part of the job.
